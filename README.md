datapipes [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/taiki45/datapipes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/taiki45/datapipes)
=========
datapipes is an asynchronous multi streaming library.

## About
datapipes encourages to handle multi streamings asynchronously. datapipes has
a few objects sparated by its responsibility.

- __Source__ Produces resources and emits the resource to pipe.
- __Tube__ Effector for resources. Processes resource in the middle of pipe.
- __Sink__ Consumer for resources. Do something with processed resources.
- __Pipe__ Resources pass through the pipe. Handles resources asynchronously.

```

To handle multi streamings, datapipes offers composable. Source, Tube and Sink
are composable individually. So the diagram above will be:

```
 Composed Source works asynchronously

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'datapipes'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install datapipes

## Usage
You have to define your own Source, Tube and Sink.

### Source
A basic source is list type. it produces a value in several times.
Use `produce` method to emit data to pipe.

```ruby
class Datapipes
  module Basics
    class List < Source
      def run
        (1..10).each {|i| produce(i) }
      end
    end
  end
end
```
